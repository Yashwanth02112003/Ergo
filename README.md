# Project Bolt - Task Management System

## Architecture Overview

This project is built using a modern tech stack with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, following a component-based architecture that emphasizes modularity and maintainability. The application implements a clean separation of concerns through custom hooks and dedicated service layers.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Backend as a Service**: Supabase
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Key Components
1. **Authentication System** (`AuthForm.tsx`, `useAuth.ts`)
   - Handles user registration and login
   - Manages session persistence
   - Implements secure token-based authentication

2. **Task Management** (`TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskForm.tsx`, `useTasks.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
   - Efficient state management for task data

3. **Context System** (`ContextHistory.tsx`, `ContextInput.tsx`, `useContexts.ts`)
   - Manages contextual information for tasks
   - Implements history tracking
   - Provides context-aware filtering

4. **Dashboard & Navigation** (`Dashboard.tsx`, `Header.tsx`)
   - Responsive layout system
   - Dynamic content organization
   - User-friendly navigation structure

### Implementation Highlights
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Component reusability through custom hooks
- Real-time data synchronization
- Responsive design principles
- Secure authentication flow
- Database schema migrations for versioning

The architecture follows best practices for modern web development, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a great user experience.
